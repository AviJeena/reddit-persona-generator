# Reddit User Persona Generator

This project takes a Reddit user profile URL and generates a detailed **user persona** using AI — based on the user's **posts and comments**. It cites the original posts or comments used to infer each trait in the persona.

This project was created as part of a Generative AI internship assignment.
